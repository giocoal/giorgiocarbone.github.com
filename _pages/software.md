# Software

I enjoy letting computers do the work for me, and have worked extensively in Python and
C++ to make this happen. In the hopes that the things I made can also help others, they
are released as open source code. I also dabble in web design and several other languages.
Below are some of my projects.

### pyGAPS

[pyGAPS](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS) is an adsorption isotherm processing and
fitting framework written in Python 3. It is open source and extensively documented. Some
of the capabilities are: routine material characterisation (specific surface area, pore
volume, pore size distribution), isotherm model fitting as well as multicomponent
adsorption prediction using IAST.

### pyGAPS-GUI

A [graphical user interface](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pyGAPS-gui) to the
pyGAPS package, written in Qt (using Python bindings). It attempts to make the
powerful functionality of pyGAPS available in an easy to use, intuitive
application.

### LaTeX paper template

A nifty LaTeX class for
[scientific publications](https://github.com/pauliacomi/scipaper-latex-class).
Attempts to look like a modern publication and comes with options such as
one/two column layouts, two-column figures, ORCID support and more.

### This website

My [personal website](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com). A
static site using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and a theme adapted from the open source
GitHub Cayman theme. Nothing too fancy (except the useless ``particle.js``
effects).
