# About me

After being especially prone to disassemble things and blow them up as a teenager, I left
my native Romania to study Chemical Engineering at Manchester. Working for a year
placement in AkzoNobel ICI paints during my degree, I realised I enjoy research, in order
to better understand and predict complex systems.

I applied for a EU Marie Curie PhD studentship to study adsorption in novel materials,
such as metal-organic frameworks (MOF). Under the mantle of project [DEFNET](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/641887),
I moved to Marseille, France to dedicate three years to understand the influence of
structural defects in MOFs on their adsorption performance and surface energetics in the [MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99)
research lab. I also developed a greater interest in adsorbent materials, with some of my
work pertaining to their shaping, characterisation and unique properties such as
compliance. Currently I am continuing my work in this field in [ICGM](https://www.icgm.fr/damp).

Training-wise, I have a comprehensive background in the adsorption of gases and vapours,
with a focus on gas storage and separation, as well as intimate knowledge of porous
coordination polymers, their characterisation, synthesis and avenues of application. Some
experience in statistical analysis, rheology and colorimetry. Familiar with many
characterisation techniques, such as thermal analysis (microcalorimetry, TGA, DSC),
spectroscopy (XRD, IR, UV) and other qualitative and quantitative methods (NMR, GC, MS).

In addition to my experimental work, I am interested in programming, particularly in
regards to high throughput data processing, extraction of key performance indicators from
large datasets and automation. I am self taught in Python and C++ and currently develop
several software packages to help me in my goals. I am a big proponent of open research
and strive to make all my software open source and as robust as possible.

When not working, I spend my time nerding out with various things such as video games,
upcycling and connecting my coffee machine to the internet.
