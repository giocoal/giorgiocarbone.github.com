# Hello

### I am a researcher studying novel adsorbent materials

My current research focuses on the study of porous materials for gas adsorption and
separation. In particular I am interested in how flexible metal-organic frameworks react
to external stimuli such as pressure, temperature and adsorbed guests. To this end, I am
working in the [DAMP](https://www.icgm.fr/damp) team at the Institut Charles Gerhard
Montpellier, under an ANR-funded [project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE29-0003) to
characterize the interplay between mechanical pressure and adsorption in porous materials.

Previously I was studying [adsorption-induced flexibility](http://www.anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE08-0048)
using calorimetric techniques in the EnAP team in [MADIREL](http://madirel.univ-amu.fr/node/99),
where I completed my PhD. My [work](/academic) also includes other aspects of MOFs such as
structural defects, synthesis and shaping. I also develop open-source [software](/software)
for various scientific applications. Some more stuff about me is [here](/about).
